Run Folium.py to display the map with our database of tweets or run GetTweet.py to get the new tweets. If you decided to run GetTweet.py, you have to wait for the program to get all the tweets you asked for (it's a bit long as it's live) then change the name of the JSON file in Folium.py and run

All files must be in the same folder (Folium.py, getTweet.py and your JSON file)
